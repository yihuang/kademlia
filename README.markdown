kademlia
========

kademlia is a haskell libraray implementing the [Kademlia][wiki_kademlia]
[distributed hash table][wiki_dht].

It aims to be flexible and handle all the low-level work, in order to allow
for easy integration of the DHT-technology into applications.

The library is built after the original [Kademlia Paper][paper_kademlia].

For more information, take a look at the libraries [hackage page][hackage].

## Implementation note (to understand some parts of code)

Flow to find nodes by key:

1) `lookupNode` => `runLookup go inst nid` : create chan `replyChan`, launch `go`
go: 
  1. send signal
  2. `expect` registration `(reg, replyChan, timeoutTid)` for this `(signal, nodeId)`
  3. wait for reply on `reg`, continue if needed (we handle nodes we know now and check whether we want to query more neighbors)

To wait for reply on `(reg, replyChan, timeoutTid)` we listen to `replyChan`

2) How incoming requests are dispatched, workers:
  1. Network.Kademlia.Networking.startRcvProcess:
      ```
        read `(signal, nodeId)` from UDP socket, combine it to reply `reply` (pure operation)
        write `reply` to `timeoutChan`
        ```
  2. Network.Kademlia.Instance.receivingProcess:
  
       ```
        read `reply` from `timeoutChan`
        (`notResponse` || `expectedReply`):
            check either:
              * there was a registration `reg` for our `reply`
              * `reply` is a request (not response)
            if call `receivingProcessDo` which calls `dispatch`
       ```
     
     
     Network.Kademlia.ReplyQueue.dispatch:
     
     
     ```
          * we check whether there is registration corresponding to `reply`
            + if there is registrartion `(reg, replyChan, timeoutTid)` then we
                  kill timeout thread by it's id `timeoutTid`
                  write `reply` to `replyChan` // futher it would be handled by thread which sent `signal` and was waiting for reply
            + if there is no registration // note, that this may happen only for requests
                  write `reply` to `defaultChan`
     ```
  3. Network.Kademlia.Instance.backgraoundProcess:
       ```
        read `reply` from `defaultChan` //note that only requests can get here
        `handleCommand` for `reply`
        ```
